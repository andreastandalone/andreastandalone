# Hi, I'm Andrea

I’m a freelance Front-End Web Developer with a strong background in UX and visual design.

Since 2006, I’ve been crafting websites, e-commerce platforms, landing pages, and apps in collaboration with agencies and clients across many industries. My strength lies at the intersection of design and development: I translate visual identities into interactive, responsive, and accessible code, while ensuring smooth communication between designers, developers, and stakeholders.

I specialize in React, WordPress, and modern Front-End stacks (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Tailwind, GSAP), with a focus on performance, accessibility, and technical SEO. My projects often include engaging animations and micro-interactions that turn interfaces into memorable experiences.

Beyond clean and well-structured code, I value adaptability: I can quickly integrate into different workflows, environments, and coding practices. I cover the full development process, from CMS setup to live deployment.
